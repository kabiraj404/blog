Hi future me, <br>
Today is 08 July 2024 <br>

Through this first blog post, I want to self check myself after a year. This is for fun and self assesemnt only. <br> 

By the next year at this time: <br>
o I would have gained some muscular weight (now 64)
o Make a habit of doing regular exercise or going to the gym regularly ( now once or twice a week and irregular)
o Visited atleast 3 new states. 
o Submitted atleast one manuscript (now zero). 
o Improve my economic status, get grants and scholarships (now none). 
o Expand my friends circle. 
o Read 10 books (check goodread), watch 20 movies (check letterboxd), write 15 blogs (check here), prepare 5 audioblog, 100 photos (check 500px)
o stop facebook, insta one random photo 

I will rank myself after a year, almost at the same time.
