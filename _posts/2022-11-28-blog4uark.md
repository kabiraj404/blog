She was so happy, happy in the most possible way. 

She was exclaiming, I found the God. I am so lucky. I found the God.

I was perplexed to see her. 

God!! 

Yes !! oh yes, [ lord Vishnu, our supreme God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu ).

Look at this, she showed me a small stone with some pattern in it.She added: “these are the footprint of the God. If we keep it in our home and pray for it, there will be peace and prosperity in the family”. 

For me, it was just a stone with a beautiful pattern in it. 

I don’t want to tell anything about the belief system, but as I saw the pattern on the stone, I was captivated, it was marvelous. These imprints on the stone were marvelous and seems these reflects the geological time. I started searching more about them.

I was in Nepal, a land-locked country, situated between India and China. It has an area of 147,181 sq km (56,827 square miles). I was on vacation with my family, on a religious trek, in the middle of the mountains. 
The location is called Manang and lies in the north leeward side of the two majestic mountains the Annapurna (8,091 m)( 26546 feet) and Dhaulagiri (8,172 m) (26811feet) ranges. It is the semi arid high mountain region and lies on the rain-shadow side. The nnual precipitation ranges from 100-400 mm
We had hired a helicopter to take the flight from Kathmandu (capital of Nepal) to Muktinath ( a religious temple of the area) situated near to the Kaligandagi river in Manang area. 
We stayed in the Kagbeni Hotel. 
The landscape had allured me, it didn’t have much vegetation. I was feeling as if I was walking in the conglomerate of sand and gravel -systematically and beautifully arranged. It felt as if I was a small ant walking in the gigantic recently made structure. 
At first, I was perplexed to find that these are the shells of the ocean species appearing on the river originating in the landlocked country. 
The Kali Gandaki river -- originates from Himalaya (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Gandaki_Gorge ), so how did these awesome architecture were found in this region !!
What could have bought these pieces in the middle of the poor landlocked country. Had it been found in some of the rich countries, this place would have been marked as a natural heritage site and well preserved. But here these ammonites and other shells are sold in less than a dollar each day – in thousands of numbers.

On the way to the temple, I saw an old woman selling the ammonites.
Did you collect this? 
No, I used to collect them while I was young but now, I am old, my relatives collect them for me.
Can I find them anywhere? I asked.
Muktinath temple is commonly known as the home of Vishnu, (nath means lord and mukti means Salvation, the lord of Salvation). This Kali-Gandaki is the place of God, and these God gifts are left around his home, but not far away. She pointing towards the river: Do you see that river !!, if I walk half an hour, I used to find nearly 10-20 of them but now my children are telling me that they must go further to find them and they don’t bring much. The influence of more tourists has decreased the availability of it. 
Dhital, M. R. (2015) in his book Geology of the Nepal Himalaya: regional perspective of the classic collided orogen shares that this Himalayan region is renowned in the world for its pristine scenery, spectacular geological exposures with predominance of the ammonites. In the chapter Introduction to Tethys Himalaya he highlights the different species of ammonites found in the different regions. According to him, there are 67 species near to the Jomsom ( a area on the stretch of Kali Gandaki river and these ammonites are also found in the other parts of Nepal like Tinkar LIpu, Dolpa and Everest region). 
The studies by Messerschmidt, D. A. (1983) have found that these stones are found in the precipice and riverbed, where river has washed down the earth. The common genera found are: Prograyicears, Blanfordiceras and Paraboliceras. And they date to the early Oxfordian to Late Tothonian Age (165 to 140 million years ago) at the end of the Juarrasic Period.



In the next day morning, she was so happy that she was showing ammonites at her hand. I don’t know how long she walked but she was so happy and was showing the ammonites that she had found on the river channel. This is the time, she was expressing that she had found the God.  
Before starting this travel, she was curious as well as a bit frightened due to the exotic location. But today she is happy because she was able to be on the temple and now, she found the God. She believes she got salvation. 
She took the helicopter and flew back to Kathmandu at around 7 am in the morning. I had planned to walk to the nearest airport, Jomsom, observe the landscape and fly back tomorrow. 
I walked from Muktinath, to Jomsom.  It will take me nearly three-four hours of downhill walk. I thought it would be ok, but the wind speed was so high. I had wind all over my face. I could hardly walk in the proper way, my walking speed was highly reduced. The small pebbles that came along with the wind were hitting me all over my body. I thought my glasses were broken. The wind quickly started after 10’oclock, and attained between 70 and 90 km/hr.
I was surprised to see the caves in the gigantic mountains along the way. What could have created these artificial cave systems in Muktinath Valley, nearly 1000 m (3200 ft) above the location of the community, in between the mountains? Did the people stay in those locations during the past? Did the erosion blow all this land? Are those the remains from the erosion ?

My curiosity grows as I spend more time observing the landscape.
Simons, A., & Schön, W. (1998) studied the caves in the region and found that these caves are interconnected complexes with several stories, connected by staircase and galleries. In some cases, these cave systems or terrace settlement could be as many as 14 stories over hundred individual rooms. However, most of them had 12 to 40 chambers. The floor area was around 4-12 m2 and height is of only 1.2-1.6m. Based on 14C dating, it is assumed the initial settlement began around 1200 calBC and continued until the 5th century calBC. 
The archaeological study of the area shows that these caves were also used as the community burial chamber from ca. 400 BC to 50 AD. In this study by Alt and his team in 2003 showed that the individuals were well adapted to the extreme environment. Does this mean that the ancient people stayed in those caves in an attempt to hide from the extreme weather ? Is the current landscape formed due to the wind and river erosion in the area. 
Along with the wind, the erosive power of the water plays an important role. In this region, the summer is the prime time of the precipitation and it is also the time when there is higher temperatures. Therefore, the summer also coincides with the melting of snow in the high mountains, hence increasing the flow of water in the river and hence the erosive power enhances.
In the ariticle by Haffner, W., & Pohle, P. published in 1993, highlights that along with the sand and water erosion, there had been glacier lake outburst, and flood which has significantly changed the landscape of the region. A similar study on the alluvial and debris from the region by Monique and Etienne during 2013 study shows that the region has been significantly changed due to the avalanche, rock flood and sediment removal.

My face was hurting, the small pebbles that came along with the wind were hitting my face, I finally found a hotel in Jomsom and stayed in it.
I ate my breakfast and was getting ready for the flight, but the hotel owner came to my room, and told me that the flight had been cancelled, due to the bad weather. All the flights for today are cancelled. And they don’t know when the next flight is, maybe tomorrow may be not. The next regular flight, according to them is after three days. 
My phone was hardly giving any connection signal. I had to walk nearly an hour to get the strong tele-communication signal. I called my mother. She was not anxious that I was not returning but was happy that I was in the pilgrimage place. I was never a religious person in her eye, so she was happy that I was staying in the lap of the God. 
I was feeling that. 
The place had interesting alluring capacity, therefore, many tourists not only from Nepal but from India come to this temple and take a dip in the holy water. They believe that it rejuvenates life. 
I don’t know if poverty is bliss or a problem.  I got a good night’s sleep. There was no ac, no proper temperature, it was cold, and I was staying in a house made of rock and wood without proper insulation. The sanitation was poor. But in spite of it, my stomach was good, I was feeling healthy. 
Each day I am getting new information and enthusiasm. I think I can spend one week exploring and talking to the people. It was my second night in the area. 
On the early next day, I planned to go to one of the mountains to see if I could find something interesting. may be some pattern of erosion or may be another God!!  
Based on the sediment budgent and fluxes study by Fort, M., & Cossart, E. (2013) the authors reasonably assumes that the current location where there is thick debris flow deposit was the region of the Mt Dhaulagiri glacial tongue and it was ice-free during the last glacial maximum, while it might have been temporarily impounded by sediment export during the Holocene. 
According to Blum, (2007) paper, quaternary glacial–interglacial cycles of climate change have had a profound impact on fluvial systems. Therefore, it is likely that during the glacial period, there might have been glacial advancement in the region because it lies in the vicinity to the two of the highest mountains peak that are above 8000 m of the world. Similarly, during the interglacial period, there might have been major glacier retreat, exposing and transporting the subsurface materials. 
If we observe the stacking of the sand and gravel, keenly we could see the strata of the deposition. According to Monecke et al in 2001 the deposition pattern and strata of layers is seen in these area is often the glacial and redeposited glacial material. These materials are observed from the erosion and show the remarkable change in sediment supply, water discharge and climatic variations. The melting of the glacier could be one of the reasons for the high amounts of morainic materials in the valleys. These materials could have been mobilized probably after the retreat of ice at the beginning of a warm period. 

I got hungry out of nowhere. 
I started searching for a nearby location where I could eat. 
The roads were everywhere. It had spread out just like the branches of the tree, at its free will. It was just there. Unplanned urbanization has accelerated the erosion process. It had act as the catalyst for the natural process of the erosion – changing the form and structures of the landscape. 
According to Messerschmidt, D. A., & Sharma, J. (1981) this Muktinath region has secular association with the concept of devotion, natural features like presence of quaternary fossils and representation of the historical development of the landscape. When I am here, I can observe the history and present scenario both at the same time. The presence of the anthropogenic and natural process. 
I felt this place as the live museum of the geological and natural processes. If we closely observe, we can see the linkage between the deep time and the present time. Hence this place has been culturally and scientifically important, (Haffner, W., & Pohle, P. (1993).
In one of the papers in 2015 Fort, M., has tried to untangle the natural hazards versus anthropogenic climate change and their potential impacts on the upper Kali Gandaki and states that dramatic headward erosion, pluses of gullying, mass wasting, landslide, flash flood and debris flow has played a significant role after the deglaciation period. Similarly, Fort and Cossart in 2013 states that currently about 80% of the former lacustrine sediment is eroded. It is assumed that there was sediment exportation rate of minimum about 20,000 m3/year. 
In the chapter Too Much Too Fast, of the book Tourism and Development in Mountain region, Gurung, & Maureen, (2000) states that this isolated, culturally, and historically significant place has been severely impacted due to the unplanned development.  Similarly, the study by Shrestha, A. B., & Aryal, R. (2011) has shown that the warming climate has resulted in rapid shrinking of glaciers in Nepal with changes in the hydrological regime. And this region is not far from it. Likewise, the impact of climate on the permafrost, agricultural productivity, livelihood is not aloof from the adverse effects of climate. 
The climate is one factor, but while observing this unique topography I felt that the natural process defines the landscape. Recent activities of humans have influenced the natural process to some extent. But if there is war between anthropogenic and natural process in this location, I assume natural process will win the competition. It seems natural processes are the key to change. Humans have played with the key, but humans still don’t know how large this key is and how does the key works. 
I looked at the watch. 
I still don’t know whether I will be able to fly tomorrow or not. Shall I hire the local bus? 
The road to this place is treacherous. I had watched the top gear Nepal episode where they had driven to this place. (youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiI78eVxh24 ) and it was beautifully bad experience for the driver. 
This was the religious trip; may be next time I should do the scientific expedition trip. I should bring some friends who have knowledge about archeology and climatology. Who could it be? Let me think!! May be next year I should bring both of my son and daughter with me. But will they be able to understand the concept of the God. The beauty and science behind this location. 
I am myself having difficulty understanding science, how could they? But will my grandchildren be able to see these marvelous stone piece? Will they be as happy as my mother was! Will these ammonites and this location hold the same sacred space as it holds now!!
A message popped up in my phone.
Is it from some from Dr. Amrita, she might know more details about it.
The message read: Dai kata hununcha, bholi pilen aaudai cha, tapai janey ho? (Brother, where are you? a plane is coming tomorrow. Shall I book a ticket for you?) 
I was happy and trying to reply to his text. 
And 
The battery of my phone got dead; my phone turned off. I looked around. The sun was setting in the west. There was not any house or person. I was a tiny animal in the middle of the gigantic mountains. All I could hear was the sound of the wind.
