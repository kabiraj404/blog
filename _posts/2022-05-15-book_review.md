At first, I thought it was a travelogue, oh it seems interesting; a man riding across the country with his young son and two friends (a married couple). In the middle section, I felt the author is sharing some philosophical ideas with the help of a character. As I listened about seventy percent of the book, it made me realize that the book is more convoluted. The lead of the book is on the road to escape his past, but instead starts remembering and observing it more vividly. He starts to struggle with memory. At the end, I feel love towards his son. 

The son is the best character in the book. There is not much space for the son. But he reflected the real in us. Those agonies, those suffocations. He is the best and most honest character in the book. 

The lead author is busy showing his philosophical thoughts and the son is just there. 

In one of the instances he states:  

“What’s the matter?” I ask.

“It’s so different.”

“What?”

“Everything. I never could see over your shoulders before.”

The sunlight makes strange and beautiful designs through.....I never realized it. All this time he’s been staring into my back. 


A persona keeping another persona in the shed. 

Was Aristotle, Plato .... keeping another persona, during their time, in the shade, stopping their ideas to flourish. The winner writes the story. I remembered [Diogenes ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes). 

Would the history be different if Diogenes had written something? Stoicism is often linked to him, but mainstream media loves to link it with the teaching of Plato. But the main question is who knows Diogenes, nobody !! Had he been the part of the political system or instead of mocking or asking Alexander the Great to stand out of his sunlight. He would have been a different persona and the history might have been written differently.

But I can't say anything because [the death of Seneca ]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger#/media/File:Manuel_Dom%C3%ADnguez_S%C3%A1nchez_-_El_suicidio_de_S%C3%A9neca.jpg) fascinates me. The politics is a phenomenal thing to unlock. 


Another thing that captured me in the book "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values" by Robert M Pirsig is the concept of the ghost. 

They are just ghosts, immortal gods of the modern mythos which appear to us to be real because we are in that mythos. But in reality, they are just as much an artistic creation as the anthropomorphic Gods they replaced.....Modern man has his ghosts and spirits too, you know.”

“What?”

“Oh, the laws of physics and logic…the number system…the principle of algebraic substitution. 

These are ghosts. 

We just believe in them so thoroughly they seem real.”

I felt this to be a true and honest opinion. We are surrounded by the ghosts and we often don't know this is true or illusion. Another true opinion is related to Mountain climbing. 

Mountains should be climbed with as little effort as possible and without desire. The reality of your nature should determine the speed...... each footstep isn’t just a means to an end but a unique event in itself. This leaf has jagged edges. This rock looks loose. From this place, the snow is less visible, even though closer. These are things you should notice anyway. To live only for some future goal is shallow. 


Overall, I found the book to be structurally well constructed with an engaging narrative. 

"…physical discomfort is important only when the mood is wrong. Then you fasten on to whatever thing is uncomfortable and call that the cause. But if the mood is right, then physical discomfort doesn’t mean much.”

Maybe I was in a good mood while reading this book. I don't know. 

But this book brilliantly explores personal life with lots of metaphors and simple examples. 

I find it worth reading.

Here are some of the interesting lines from the book: 


-- “You look at where you're going and where you are and it never makes sense, but then you look back at where you've been and a pattern seems to emerge.” 

-- “We’re in such a hurry most of the time we never get much chance to talk. The result is a kind of endless day-to-day shallowness, a monotony that leaves a person wondering years later where all the time went and sorry that it’s all gone. ” 

-- “The law of gravity and gravity itself did not exist before Isaac Newton." ...and what that means is that that law of gravity exists nowhere except in people's heads! It 's a ghost!"

-- “We keep passing unseen through little moments of other people’s lives.” 

-- “Dad?"
"What?" 
"What should I be when I grow up?"
"Honest," I finally say.”
