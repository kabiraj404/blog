I know I was being piece of shit
But what could I have done
I am sorry for myself that I didn’t see that chainsaw coming.
I was happy and thought it was permanent
But I never realized that I was small part of the play.

Her acts were more beautiful 
I just wanted more synchronicity among us
hoping there is joyous in the future to grow together
Fuck me, I should have shouted more in the beginning 
Before it even began

I just let the house to be destroyed in front of me
She was afraid that I would destroy her wings
I had assured her I would let her grow
I just presented, a little brutal site of myself
Thinking there is life ahead to enjoy the company
We had communication issue 
But we were trying
I was trying to understand her body language and she was watching my eyes in detail
We were struggling 
But we were hopeful that both of us of have a great future ahead of us

I tried but I failed, failed for a reason? 
I still don’t have answer
But how long could have I been a puppet 
How long could she be fearful with me
I was overthinker
She was adolescent 

I am trying to make myself numb
To feel nothing 
But that little red color and bush still haunt me in the night

I imagined that my mood and her life will glow together 
But fuck me, I became afraid
To hold the chaos for long, I just remained silent for some time. 
Made sure that the chainsaw didn’t hurt her
But she didn’t believe me
Next day she is gone, home is now a memory
I wish she is happy and formed a family by now

I am alone, peeping from the window
With a dead horse in front of me and the ghost of future 
Wishing she is here, to hold the hand 
We might have shared joy together 
But I know I am piece of shit
