actually I had been Khopra danda trek on the last week of February. This is newly introduced short and delightful trek near to the Ghorepani-Poonhill Trek at the Annapurna Region of Nepal. THis Khopra danda (ridge ) is at teh elevation of around 3660 masl. While I was there, it was snowy and had awesome view of the Annapurna South (7219 masl). It is majestic feeling to be close to the mountain. I reached there at the late afternoon. To get there, I was walking in the snow, I was nearly lost becasue the trekking route was covered by the snow. I was alone. The clouds was all around me. Snowfall was increasing. I was not able to get any view. But I thanked myself becasue I reached a hotel finally. It was chilling cold. When I wake up early morning, I felt I am too close to the mountain. It was so damn close. I didn't have any words to explain it. 

Likewise, I was on the Mardi himal view point (4200 masl) on the third week of March. Within two to three  days of the walk from Pokhara we can get amazing mountain views from this location. It is located ont eh eastward of the classic Annapurna Base camp. It provides an extraordinary spectacles of Machhapuchhre and other peaks. In my experience, it is one of the best trekking expreince for those who have limited time but want the elegant view of the mountains. 

Apart from the glorious view of the mountain, from both of these locations, the hiking route is awesome. The route if filled with the beautiful landscape, best panoramic view, interesting culture, forest types mixed with the hospitality of the local people. 

Last week, as I was watching a photography channel. I got inspiration to create a photography book based on these two treks. Both of these locations are not that far from each other. I thought it would be interesting to create a book. This is my first attempt to create a photo book. I am not sure whether I would print it or not. Here is pdf of the book for sharing.
