Two of the songs manly captivated me: 
1) If you cant give me love

<i>
Although you were surrounded by beauty unbounded
Your glance is intended for me
And though I tried to hide it
I found myself looking to see
</i>
<br>
<i>
If you can't give me love, honey, that ain't enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings with old fashioned meanings
Then just stay in love with yourself
</i>
[If you can't give me love](<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/45JKOZUyOFoLhmEltJFEeW?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe> )


2) She’s in Love with You
<i>
Though she may need a little time
She never wants to stand in line the way they would
Treat her right
Treat her good
Take her home
And make her feel the way she should
So take her home and hold her close
Touch her where she feels it most, but be true
She'll never let you down
She'll never fool around
'Coz she's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
</i>
[She is in love with you](<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5I9MwCyxn4mnJRDQBtRzvY?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe> )



Suzi Quatro is a glam rock icon with a window-rattling voice and rock & roll attitude to spare.


I was in Nepal, a land-locked country, situated in between India and China. It has an area of 147,181 sq km (56,827 square miles). I was on vacation with my family, on a religious trek, in the middle of the mountains. <br>
The location is called Manang, and lies in the north leeward side of the two majestic mountains the Annapurna (8,091 m)( 26546 ft) and Dhaulagiri (8,172 m) (26811ft) ranges. 

We hired a helicopter to take the flight from Kathmandu (capital of Nepal) to Muktinath (a religious temple of the area) situated near to the Kali-Gandagi river in Manang area. <br>
We stayed in the Kagbeni Hotel. 

The landscape allured me, it didn’t have much vegetation. I was feeling as if I was walking in the conglomerate of sand and gravel -- systematically and beautifully arranged. It felt as if I was a small ant walking in the gigantic recently made structure. 

At first, I was perplexed to see this unique topography in the Himalayan region, and then the existance of the shells of extinct invertibrate within the Phylum Mollusca. According to [Natural History Museum](https://natmus.humboldt.edu/exhibits/fossil-focus-exhibits/what-ammonite) these species thrived in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras, which equates to approximately 408 to 65 million years ago. These species have been useful in indicating the locations of ancient seas within the geologic record.
