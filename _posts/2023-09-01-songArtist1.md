Two of the songs manly captivated me: 
1) If you cant give me love
<br>
<i>
Although you were surrounded by beauty unbounded <br>
Your glance is intended for me<br>
And though I tried to hide it<br>
I found myself looking to see<br>
If you can't give me love, honey, that ain't enough <br>
Let me go look for somebody else<br>
If you can't give me feelings with old fashioned meanings<br>
Then just stay in love with yourself <br>
</i>

<br>

2) She’s in Love with You <br>
<i>
Though she may need a little time <br>
She never wants to stand in line the way they would<br>
Treat her right<br>
Treat her good<br>
Take her home<br>
And make her feel the way she should<br>
So take her home and hold her close<br>
Touch her where she feels it most, but be true<br>
She'll never let you down<br>
She'll never fool around<br>
'Coz she's in love with you<br>
That's all she wants to do<br>
</i>

Suzi Quatro is a glam rock icon with a window-rattling voice and rock & roll attitude to spare.


I was in Nepal, a land-locked country, situated in between India and China. It has an area of 147,181 sq km (56,827 square miles). I was on vacation with my family, on a religious trek, in the middle of the mountains. <br>
The location is called Manang, and lies in the north leeward side of the two majestic mountains the Annapurna (8,091 m)( 26546 ft) and Dhaulagiri (8,172 m) (26811ft) ranges. 

We hired a helicopter to take the flight from Kathmandu (capital of Nepal) to Muktinath (a religious temple of the area) situated near to the Kali-Gandagi river in Manang area. <br>
We stayed in the Kagbeni Hotel. 

The landscape allured me, it didn’t have much vegetation. I was feeling as if I was walking in the conglomerate of sand and gravel -- systematically and beautifully arranged. It felt as if I was a small ant walking in the gigantic recently made structure. 

At first, I was perplexed to see this unique topography in the Himalayan region, and then the existance of the shells of extinct invertibrate within the Phylum Mollusca. According to [Natural History Museum](https://natmus.humboldt.edu/exhibits/fossil-focus-exhibits/what-ammonite) these species thrived in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras, which equates to approximately 408 to 65 million years ago. These species have been useful in indicating the locations of ancient seas within the geologic record.
