I know I was being piece of shit <br>
But what could have I done <br>
I am sorry for myself that I didn’t see the chainsaw coming <br>

Her acts were more beautiful <br>
I was happy and thought it would be permanent <br>
I just wanted more synchronicity among us <br>
Hoping there is joyous in the future <br>
For us, to grow together <br>
But I never realized that I was small part of the play <br>
Fuck me, I should have shouted loud in the beginning <br>
Before the simulation <br>

She was afraid that I would destroy her wings <br>
But irony is <br>
I let my house to be destroyed in front of me <br>
I had assure her that I would let her grow <br>
I just presented, a little brutal side of myself <br>
Thinking there is life ahead, to enjoy the company <br>
We had communication issue <br>
But we were trying <br>
I was trying to understand her body language and she was watching my eyes in detail <br>
We were struggling <br>
But we were hopeful that both of us of will have a great future ahead<br>

I tried but I failed, failed for a reason? <br>
I still don’t have any answer, any reason <br>
But how long could I have been a puppet <br>
How long could she be fearful with me <br>
I was overthinker <br>
She was adolescent <br>

I am trying to make myself numb <br>
To feel nothing <br> 
But her color and style still haunt me in the night <br>

I imagined that my mood and her life will glow together <br>
But fuck me, I became afraid <br>
To hold the chaos for long, I just remained silent for some time <br>
To make sure that the chainsaw didn’t hurt her <br>
But she didn’t believe me <br>
Next day she was gone, home is now a memory <br>

I wish she is happy and has a family by now <br>

I am alone, peeping from the window <br>
With a dead horse in front of me and the ghost of future <br>
Wishing she is here, to hold the hand <br>
We might have shared joy together <br>
But I know I am piece of shit <br>

Dedidated to her
